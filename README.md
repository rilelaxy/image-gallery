# Single-HTML-Page-Project
Students will design a single web page project that matches their project plan that they submitted in class.

## Project Requirements
Are listed in the README file in the `image_gallery` folder.
You must meet all requirements in the following areas:
* HTML - meet specific elements
* Validity - passes the W3C Validator (HTML and CSS)
* CSS - meet specific CSS requirements (layout, colors & fonts)
* Design - your design score will be assessed based on the video captures &/or screen captures (you'll want to see the rubric in the assignment description for the course)

## Instructions
1. Place all of your project files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) into the simple_html_page folder.
2. Clone this project: `git clone `.
3. Open the projec tin VS Code (double click on `Image-Gallery-Project.code-workspace`)
4. Open the terminal (View > New Terminal).
5. Install the Python extension: ***Python extension for Visual Studio Code***
6. In the terminal, type `poetry shell`.
    - You should see a line saying something like `Spawning shell within C:\Users\my_username\AppData\Local\pypoetry\Cache\virtualenvs\Image-Gallery-Project-IMtvp_MA-py3.9`
7. Note the name of your virtual environment file, which will look something like `Image-Gallery-Project-IMtvp_MA-py3.9`
8. Open the Command Palette 
    - in the menu it's: View > Command Palette
    - you could also type `Ctrl + Shift + P`
9. Type Python: Select Interpreter
    - if you see the virtual environment file, click it.
    - if you don't see it, click `Select at Workspace level`
10. Select the virtual environment file from above (it should show the word Poetry in blue on the right)
    - if you don't see it, close VS Code and re-open it and repeat steps 8 and 9.
11. Type `poetry update` and wait for everything to install.
12. In the terminal, once everything is done installing, type `pytest`
13. If that doesn't work, click the Testing icon (looks like a beaker), then click the blue `Configure Python Tests` button, then select `pytest pytest framework` and choose the `tests` folder.
14. Place your content in the `image_gallery` folder.
15. Store all images (both full size and thumbnail sized images).
16. Select a theme for your images and style.
17. Test your code by running pytest. The goal is to pass all tests.
18. Record your final product before turning it in.
19. The recording should show you resizing and or zooming in and out to show a variety of widths and demonstrate the flex layout is working without ever making your site look broken.
20. Be sure to commit and push your changes at regular intervals, but particularly once you finish the project.
