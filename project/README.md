# Image Gallery Project
Put your html and css files in here.

## Goal:
Students will code and design an image gallery project that contains a minimum of 9 related thumbnail-sized images that when clicked open up a full-sized version of those images. The design of the layout should be a grid of images that are styled using fonts, colors, borders, and other styles.

## Requirements
### HTML requirements
* A single web page (HTML file)
* 1 or more stylesheets (a style tag can count)
* All standard HTML5 required tags (`DOCTYPE`, `html`, `head`, `title`, `body`)
* A title (using the proper tag)
* A container element for your images (could be a `div`, `section`, or `article`)
* A minimum of 9 images each of which...
    - are stored in a single `figure`
    - contain a brief description using the `alt` attribute
    - wrapped in a link that links to the full-sized image
    - followed by a caption with appropriate credit given

### Validity Requirements
* No HTML errors
* No CSS errors

### CSS Requirements
* A font pairing.
* Background color set on the page and at least 1 other color set for text.
* Any color or background color set on an element passes the AIM color contrast checker
    - Must pass at a AAA rating for any non-heading
    - May pass at a AA rating for headings
* The container uses the `flex` property and related flex properties to contribute to the layout.
* The figures are styled using the `margin`, `border`, `padding`, and `background-color` properties

### Design Requirements
* Content must be visible and readable (with high contrast)
* Images are all related in some way (through topic or theme)
* Fonts, colors, and any other styling is consistent with the theme of the images
* Layout is fluid and works on any browser/viewport width

### Assignment Submission Requirements
* Student must commit and push their changes to the repo (repo has the latest work)
* Layout should not look broken at any width
* No horizontal scrollbars should appear unless the window is more narrow that a single figure
* Student must record their image gallery at various viewport widths (or zoom levels) - best will go towards a video showing the browser being set to different screen widths.
